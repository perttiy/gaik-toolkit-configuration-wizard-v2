# gaik-toolkit agent instructions

This repo is public: never commit machine-local paths, usernames or secret-store locations.

## gaik-sync (keep the Solution Wizard in step with gaik)

The Solution Wizard (`implementation_layer/solution_wizard/`) mirrors gaik's API in a
component registry, reference cards and selection guidance. When gaik changes they drift
silently, and the wizard generates blueprints or PoCs that fail at runtime.

After a change to gaik's public surface, remind the user to run the `gaik-sync` skill and
offer to run it. That covers adding, removing or renaming a component, module or
behaviour-changing option; changing constructor params, the primary method or its return
shape; changing a pip extra, providers or artifact types; a new subsumption; and bumping
gaik. The skill proposes changes and edits wizard assets only after approval. A quick
read-only check: `uv run python .claude/skills/gaik-sync/scripts/audit_registry.py`.

Run `uv sync --all-extras` first, and run the audit and wizard tests through `uv run`.
Components swallow a missing optional dependency in `__init__.py`, so a missing extra
makes a class silently absent: the audit reports false `removed` drift and the tests skip
checks they appear to run.

## agent-plugin (the published agent skills)

`agent-plugin/` is installed by Claude Code, Codex, Copilot and VS Code through
`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`, and its skills quote gaik's API.

- Bump `version` in both `agent-plugin/plugin.json` and
  `agent-plugin/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` with any change under `agent-plugin/`: each
  client caches an install under the version it read.
- `implementation_layer/unit_tests/test_agent_plugin.py` fails when gaik renames a name a
  skill quotes; fix the skill in the same change. It checks names only, so a change in
  behaviour needs a read of the skill that describes it.

## toolkit_demo_app on Rahti

- Deploy by pushing to the `deploy/demo-app` branch: `git push origin main:deploy/demo-app`.
  A GitHub webhook starts the BuildConfigs in `openshift/buildconfigs.yaml`, and the
  deployments roll out when the images land. `openshift/deploy.sh` is the local fallback.
- Never `oc apply` the deployment manifests in `openshift/`: the live deployments carry
  env vars (Allas, `DATABASE_URL`, TTS, report-writer limits) set with `oc set env` that
  the manifests lack, and applying them drops those.
- The API image installs gaik from PyPI, not from this repository, so a gaik fix reaches
  the demo app only after a release.
  The demo's local uv environment uses this repository's gaik as an editable install
  (`[tool.uv.sources]` in its `pyproject.toml`), so a local run can pass on a fix that
  the deployed demo lacks.
- `proxy.ts` is the only auth layer in front of the FastAPI backend; every
  state-changing method needs a signed-in, approved user (`lib/api-access.ts`); the
  wizard routes have their own gate.

## docs site (GitHub Pages)

`.github/workflows/pages.yml` publishes `guidance_layer/website` (Fumadocs, pnpm) to
https://gaik-project.github.io/gaik-toolkit/ on every push to main that touches it.
`content/docs/<path>.mdx` is served at `/gaik-toolkit/<path>/`, with no `/docs` segment.
Link that page, not the MDX file; the old docs host `gaik-toolkit.2.rahtiapp.fi` is gone.

## graphify (optional)

`graphify-out/` holds a committed knowledge graph. If the `graphify` CLI is installed,
prefer `graphify query|path|explain` for codebase questions and run `graphify update .`
after code changes. If it is not installed, use normal search and do not mention it.
Invoke `/graphify` only when that skill is listed. Dirty `graphify-out/` files are
expected.

## release certification (required before every tag and PyPI release)

- Every version tag/release requires real authenticated component tests, not only
  imports, mocked calls, or the presence of API keys. Before tagging, commit the
  intended release, set the wizard validated pin to the planned version, then run
  `uv run python scripts/release_check.py --live --version X.Y.Z`. The command runs
  all-extras sync, offline tests, wizard tests/audit, package validation, and bounded
  live component checks. A passing sanitized `results/release-check.json` must name
  the exact commit and planned version. Rerun after any tracked release change.
- Set `RELEASE_PROVIDERS` and explicit `RELEASE_<PROVIDER>_MODEL` model/deployment IDs.
  Check current official model documentation/catalogs before choosing IDs; do not
  assume a model name in an old example is current. Every changed provider/model
  family and every newly added provider needs a sanitized live smoke report before
  tagging. The normal matrix is representative; exhaustive catalog evaluation is
  separate and must not automatically run on every release.
- CI always requires Azure plus any providers selected in `RELEASE_PROVIDERS`.
  Missing selected credentials, timeouts, skipped required checks, and invalid model
  output fail the gate. Do not turn these into a pass or bypass the gate to publish.
  Aitta and other optional providers can be certified locally; do not require a
  permanently valid Aitta token for unrelated releases.
- `publish.yml` calls the test workflow with `release_gate: true`; publishing depends
  on that complete workflow succeeding. Do not tag, upload to PyPI, or deploy the
  demo until the applicable certification passes. Keep credentials, raw provider
  errors, and personal documents out of reports; use the synthetic fixtures.

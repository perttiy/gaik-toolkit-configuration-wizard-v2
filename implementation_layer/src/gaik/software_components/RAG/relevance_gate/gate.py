"""Decide whether a retrieval result means anything, and calibrate the threshold.

A vector index answers every query. Ask it for nonsense and it returns its nearest
neighbours, ranked, with scores — a full page of results that looks exactly like a
page of real answers. So *result count is not evidence*: on one measured corpus a
gibberish string came back with 24 results while a real domain question came back
with 12.

What does discriminate is the distance to the closest match. Real questions land
close to something; unanswerable ones land far from everything, and on a corpus
worth searching the two populations separate cleanly enough to put a threshold
between them.

That threshold is not a constant. It is a reading off *one* embedding model
against *one* corpus, so :meth:`RelevanceGate.calibrate` exists to take the
reading — and to say so when there is no gap to put a threshold in, which is the
answer that saves you from shipping a number that splits the difference between
two overlapping populations.

    Works on plain numbers so it fits whatever your retriever returns — a list of

    result objects.

    Args:
        floor: The threshold. A score on the *relevant* side of it passes.
        lower_is_better: ``True`` for distances (cosine distance, L2), ``False``
            for similarities (cosine similarity, ``ts_rank_cd``). Getting this
            backwards inverts the gate silently, which is why it has no default
            that suits both.

        # PgVectorStore.search_semantic returns cosine similarity, higher is closer

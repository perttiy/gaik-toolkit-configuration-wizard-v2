"""Workflow step types the user reads in the review screen (Akseli's R5).

"Export results to Excel" was shown as an AI step. V1 calls every non-human step
``automated_task``, which covered both a component calling a model and a step
that just writes the result somewhere, and both mapped to ``ai``.

The component is the tie-breaker: it is what makes the model call.

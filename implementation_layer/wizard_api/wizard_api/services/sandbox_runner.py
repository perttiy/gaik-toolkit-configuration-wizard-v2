"""Run a generated PoC package in an isolated sandbox Job (#91).

The manifest stays the single source of truth for what a run is allowed to do:
this renders `deploy/openshift/sandbox-job.yaml` exactly as
`scripts/submit-sandbox-job.sh` does, then submits it through the Kubernetes API
rather than shelling out to `oc`. The api container has no `oc` binary, and
following a pod's log needs the API anyway, so the script stays for hand-runs
and this is the path the UI uses.

The Kubernetes client is optional, like the Claude SDK in agent_service: the
module imports and its pure parts are testable without a cluster, and the parts
that need one raise a clear error instead of failing at import.

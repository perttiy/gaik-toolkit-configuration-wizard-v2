"""Which user a request acts for, and whether a session is theirs (#134, review K2).

The web app checks ownership in its proxy, but wizard_api itself handed any
session to anyone holding the service token: ``GET /sessions/{id}`` looked the
session up by UUID alone. Anything that reached the API with the token — the
wizard agent before #197, a sandbox job, a test driver — could read or change
every user's sessions.

Now the proxy names the user it acts for in ``X-Wizard-User-Id``, and every
``/sessions/{session_id}/...`` route checks that the session belongs to that
user before the handler runs. This is a router-level dependency on purpose,
like the service-token middleware: a per-handler check is the kind that gets
forgotten on the next route, and sprint4 added nine of them.

A mismatch is a 404, not a 403, so a caller cannot tell "not yours" from
"does not exist". A request *without* the header is accepted while
``WIZARD_REQUIRE_USER_HEADER`` is unset: the sandbox Job's init container and
the stack E2E helpers still call the API with the token alone (#203 / B3 add
the header there). Once every caller sends it, set the variable and a missing
header becomes a 400.

"""Service-to-service auth between wizard_v2_web and wizard_api (#132).

The web app's server-side proxy is the only legitimate caller of this API, so
a single shared secret is the right shape here. This is NOT user auth: a
caller holding the token can still act as any `user_id`. Real per-user
authentication is #134.

Implemented as middleware rather than a router dependency on purpose — a
dependency has to be remembered on every new router, and the one that gets
forgotten is the one that leaks. Middleware fails closed for anything mounted
on the app.

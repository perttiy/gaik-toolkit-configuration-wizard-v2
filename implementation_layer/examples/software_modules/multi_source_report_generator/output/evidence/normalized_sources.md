Meeting transcript. Q3 Product Roadmap Review. Date: December 15, 2024. Duration: 45 minutes. Attendees: Sarah Chen, Product Manager, Mike Rodriguez, Engineering Lead, Lisa Park, Design Lead, James Wilson, Marketing, David Kim, QA Lead. Sarah Chen: Good morning, everyone. Let's get started with our Q3 Product Roadmap Review. We have three main items to discuss today: the mobile app launch status, the dashboard redesign, and our API modernization project. Mike Rodriguez: Thanks, Sarah. Starting with the mobile app, we've completed 85% of the core features. The authentication module is done, and we're finishing up the offline sync capability. We're on track for the January 15th beta release. Lisa Park: The UI is looking great. We did user testing last week with 12 participants and got really positive feedback. The only concern was the onboarding flow users found it a bit confusing. I recommend we simplify it from five steps to three. Sarah Chen: That's a good point, Lisa. Can we make that change before beta? Mike Rodriguez: Yes, it's a relatively small change. I'll assign two developers to it. We should have it done by end of next week. James Wilson: From marketing's perspective, we need the final app screenshots by December 20th for the press kit. Can design commit to that? Lisa Park: Absolutely. I'll have those ready by the 18th to give you some buffer. Sarah Chen: Perfect. Let's move on to the dashboard redesign. David, any concerns from QA? David Kim: We found 23 bugs during regression testing. 15 are minor UI issues, but 8 are critical, mainly around data visualization accuracy. The pie charts are showing incorrect percentages in some edge cases. Mike Rodriguez: I saw those reports. We've already fixed 5 of the critical bugs. The remaining 3 should be done by Wednesday. Sarah Chen: Good. What about the API modernization? That's been our biggest challenge this quarter. Mike Rodriguez: Honestly, we need to have a difficult converse.

Q3 ROADMAP MEETING - MY NOTES
Dec 15, 2024

Key Takeaways:
--------------
* Mobile app at 85% - on track for Jan 15 beta!
* Dashboard has 8 critical bugs (data viz issues) - need fix by Wed
* API migration being phased - GraphQL read-only in Q3, write ops pushed to Q4

Action Items I Caught:
----------------------
- Mike: Assign 2 devs to simplify onboarding (5 steps -> 3 steps)
- Lisa: App screenshots due Dec 18 (marketing needs by Dec 20)
- David + Mike: Set up AWS load testing env - meeting tomorrow
- Dev team: Fix remaining 3 critical bugs by Wednesday

Decisions Made:
---------------
1. APPROVED: Phase API migration (read-only first)
2. APPROVED: Use AWS for load testing (not on-prem)
3. APPROVED: Simplify onboarding flow

Questions I Still Have:
-----------------------
- What's the budget for AWS load testing?
- Who's covering for Lisa during holiday break?
- Do we need stakeholder approval for the API phasing?

Holiday Freeze: Dec 23 - Jan 2 (NO DEPLOYMENTS!)

Next meeting: Jan 3rd

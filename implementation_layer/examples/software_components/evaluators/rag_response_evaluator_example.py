"""RAGResponseEvaluator demo — referenced + pairwise modes on synthetic data.

Runs two evaluations against synthetic RAG outputs:

1. **Referenced**: scores each candidate column against a reference answer on
   the default 4+1 rubric (coverage, contradiction, relevance, precision,
   overall) and saves a scored CSV + plots.
2. **Pairwise**: drops the reference column and judges every C(N,2) pair of
   candidates per question, pools wins, and reports a system ranking.

/**
 * Baseline security response headers (#133).
 *
 * The deployed app previously sent none of these — measured against the Rahti
 * staging deploy on 26 Aug 2026, which returned only `x-powered-by`,
 * `cache-control` and `content-type`.
 *
 * Lives here rather than inline in next.config.ts so the policy is testable
 * and the config stays thin.
 *
 * On CSP: this is deliberately NOT a strict policy. Next.js injects an inline
 * bootstrap script and bpmn-js writes inline styles into the diagram canvas,
 * so `script-src 'self'` alone breaks the workflow tab. Tightening to nonces
 * needs a middleware pass and is scoped out of this ticket. What is here still
 * blocks what actually matters for this app: loading code or styles from a
 * foreign origin, being framed, and posting a form off-site.

// Bug this covers: the customer reviewer completed a whole PoC via chat alone — the
// workspace panel never followed, so nothing was ever visible ("the chat and this user
// interface are not in sync"). These pin the exact milestone crossings that must
// switch tabs, and the cases that must NOT.

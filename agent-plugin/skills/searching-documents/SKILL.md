  Builds and debugs retrieval with the gaik toolkit — PgVectorStore, Ranker,
  FinnishTextProcessor, RelevanceGate — as hybrid search: pgvector similarity
  plus Postgres full-text, fused by rank, and the same design in plain SQL for a
  TypeScript app. Use whenever gaik is used for search or RAG retrieval,
  whenever Finnish text is indexed for full-text search, when adding semantic or
  hybrid search over document chunks, and when deciding whether a search found
  anything relevant at all. Also use when search misbehaves without an error: a
  sentence query gets no keyword hits, a word visibly in the text is not found,
  hybrid returns what vector-only returns, gibberish fills a page of results, or
  a similarity threshold never filters anything; and when measuring retrieval
  with Hit@K or MRR, or judging whether a reranker, synonyms, or query
  translation helped.

# Searching documents with gaik

```bash
pip install "gaik[pg-vector-store,embedder,ranker]"
pip install "gaik[finnish-rag]"   # Finnish lemmatization
```

Hybrid search runs two arms that fail differently. The vector arm finds passages that
answer in other words; the keyword arm finds exact tokens an embedding blurs — a section
number, a standard's code, a product name. Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) combines them by
rank position, so a cosine similarity and a `ts_rank_cd` never have to share a scale.

Building that takes an afternoon. What costs weeks is that **either arm can stop working
without an error**, and the page still fills with plausible results because the other arm
keeps answering. Most of this skill is about making that failure visible.

## Keep vector-only as a mode and make hybrid earn its place

Do not assume hybrid wins. On one 92-question set, vector-only matched hybrid's recall from
top-10 upwards with a slightly better MRR at an eighth of the latency; hybrid won only at
top-5. That metric asks whether one chunk was found, so it cannot see the case hybrid
exists for — an exact code or section number — and on other corpora the keyword arm was
the only thing that found those at all.

So ship three modes behind one parameter — `hybrid`, `vector`, `keyword` — and judge hybrid
against vector-only on a query set that contains exact tokens. The modes double as the
cheapest health check there is (below).

## The gaik recipe

```python
from gaik.software_components.config import get_openai_config
from gaik.software_components.RAG.embedder import Embedder
from gaik.software_components.RAG.pg_vector_store import PgVectorStore
from gaik.software_components.RAG.ranker import Ranker

# model= is the deployment name on Azure; its output size must equal embedding_dim
embedder = Embedder(get_openai_config(use_azure=True), model="text-embedding-3-small")

store = PgVectorStore(
    "postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/search",
    embedding_dim=1536,
    fts_language="finnish",    # "simple" when a text_processor supplies lemmas (below)
    tsquery_mode="or",         # a sentence query still matches; ts_rank_cd ranks
    hnsw_ef_search=100,
)
store.setup()                                  # table, HNSW + GIN indexes, SQL functions
embeddings, docs = embedder.embed(chunks)      # chunks: list[langchain Document]
store.add(docs, embeddings)

query_vec = embedder.embed_query(query)
semantic = store.search_semantic(query_vec, top_k=50, threshold=0.0)
keyword = store.search_keyword(query, top_k=50)
hits = Ranker(expose_ranks=True).fuse(
    semantic, keyword, names=("semantic", "keyword"), weights=(1.0, 1.0), top_k=10
)
```

`Embedder` also accepts `get_llm_config()` from `gaik.software_components.llm` for
native `google`/`vertex`, `aitta`, `openai_compatible`, or optional `litellm`. Native
Google/Vertex needs `gaik[llm-google]`; LiteLLM needs `gaik[llm-litellm]` and an explicit
provider-prefixed `embedding_model` (or `LITELLM_EMBEDDING_MODEL`). Aitta requires
`AITTA_API_KEY` (also accepts `AITTA_API_TOKEN` or `AITTA_TOKEN`) and an explicit
`AITTA_EMBEDDING_MODEL`, or an `embedding_model` config override naming an embedding model
available on Aitta. A chat model is not an embedding model. Other compatible servers need their endpoint, API key,
and an explicit embedding model. Use the same embedding model for indexing and queries,
and match `embedding_dim` to its output. Native Anthropic does not provide embeddings.

For the Chroma-based end-to-end module, choose the three model stages independently:

```python
from gaik.software_components.llm import get_llm_config
from gaik.software_modules.RAG_workflow import RAGWorkflow

workflow = RAGWorkflow(
    parser_config=get_llm_config("openai", model="gpt-6-luna"),
    embedding_config=get_llm_config("google", embedding_model="gemini-embedding-001"),
    answer_config=get_llm_config("aitta"),
)
```

Install `gaik[rag-workflow,llm-google]` for this example. The parser model must accept
images; answer generation only needs chat. Each omitted stage uses shared `api_config`
or the legacy OpenAI/Azure default. When all stages are explicit, no unrelated default
credentials are loaded. `RAGWorkflow` uses Chroma; the PostgreSQL recipe above remains
the path for `PgVectorStore`.

Fuse the two lists yourself instead of calling `store.search_hybrid()`:

- the semantic list keeps its cosine similarities, which the relevance gate needs —
  `search_hybrid()` returns only RRF scores;
- `expose_ranks=True` writes `rank_semantic` and `rank_keyword` into every hit's metadata,
  so an arm that contributes nothing shows up per result;
- through gaik 0.7.2 `search_hybrid()` ignores `tsquery_mode` and always parses in
  `websearch` mode, which ANDs every term, and `search_hybrid_weighted()` fails on every
  call with `column reference "id" is ambiguous`.

**Tune the weights and the RRF constant, do not assume them.** Where the keyword arm alone
reached 33.7% recall@15, equal weights at k=60 scored 8.7 points below vectors weighted 3×
at k=20 (`Ranker(rrf_k=...)` sets k).

**`embedding_dim` must equal the model's output, and at most 2,000.** `setup()` builds an
HNSW index on `vector(N)`, which pgvector refuses above 2,000 dimensions. Without `model=`,
`Embedder` falls back to a default that depends on the config helper, and two of them
are too large: `get_openai_config()` gives `text-embedding-3-large` (3,072) and
`get_llm_config("google")` or `"vertex"` gives `gemini-embedding-001` (3,072).
`get_llm_config("openai")` or `"azure"` gives `EMBEDDING_MODEL`, else
`text-embedding-3-small` (1,536). Pass `model=` explicitly, pick a model (or a
deployment) that outputs 2,000 or fewer, or build the schema yourself with `halfvec`,
which indexes up to 4,000: `references/postgres-without-gaik.md`.

## Three ways the keyword arm returns nothing, silently

1. **The tsquery ANDs a sentence.** `websearch_to_tsquery` and `plainto_tsquery` conjoin
   every term, so a nine-word question only matches a passage containing all nine stems —
   on real prose, none. Rewrite `&` to `|` and let `ts_rank_cd` rank by how many terms
   matched and how close together. In gaik that is `tsquery_mode="or"`.
2. **The index column is empty.** On one production system the tsvector column existed as a
   plain nullable column instead of the `GENERATED ALWAYS AS (…) STORED` column the
   migration declared. Every row was NULL for about six months, the GIN index indexed
   nothing, and "hybrid" was vector search the whole time. Users noticed first.
3. **The query is in another language than the index.** Postgres full-text cannot cross
   languages: an English question against a `finnish` index took the keyword arm's
   recall@15 from 33.7% to 5.4%, and hybrid became vector-only. Translate the query into the
   corpus language **as a question, not a keyword list** — a keyword list helped the keyword
   arm but wrecked the vector arm and ended 14 points below not translating at all.

A fourth, rarer: zero-width characters (U+200B) pasted in from a CMS glue onto words.
Postgres does not treat them as whitespace, so the word stays unstemmed and never matches.
Strip them at ingest and at query time.

**Check the arms are alive, against the live database.** A unit test cannot see a column
the migration declared correctly and the database never got. Run these from a health
endpoint or a startup check:

- rows with a NULL tsvector: 0, or exactly the rows deliberately left unindexed;
- a word copied out of a random stored chunk, searched in keyword mode, returns that chunk;
- one query in `hybrid` and in `vector` mode: identical result lists mean the keyword arm is
  contributing nothing.

## Finnish and other inflected languages

Postgres' `finnish` snowball stemmer is inconsistent across a word family —
`tilinpäätös` stems to `tilinpäätös`, `tilinpäätöksen` to `tilinpäätöks` — so a search for
one form misses a passage containing the other, and nothing reports the miss. Lemmatize
**both sides** with the same analyser. Measured on sentences queried in a different
inflection than the document used: snowball matched 1 of 4, every prefix strategy 0–1 of
4, lemmas on both sides 4 of 4.

```python
from gaik.software_components.RAG.finnish_text_processor import FinnishTextProcessor

# A named backend raises ImportError when it is missing; only "auto" falls back
# silently, to "simple", a tokenizer rather than a lemmatizer.
processor = FinnishTextProcessor(backend="pyvoikko", decompound=False)

store = PgVectorStore(dsn, embedding_dim=1536, fts_language="simple",
                      text_processor=processor, tsquery_mode="or")
```

Read `references/finnish.md` before indexing Finnish. The rules that each cost a debugging
session:

- **Pin the backend.** `backend="auto"` picks native libvoikko where it is installed and
  something else where it is not, so a laptop indexes different lemmas than the container
  queries with, and the arm silently stops matching. `pyvoikko` is pure Python and runs
  everywhere, including images where libvoikko is not packaged.
- **Start with `decompound=False`** — gaik defaults to `True`. With both sides lemmatized,
  whole compounds already match, and splitting adds noise: `arvonlisävero` yields `arvo`,
  which reaches `arvopaperi`. Index and query must agree; changing it means re-indexing.
- **Long questions flood the lemma arm.** A 25-word question became ~20 OR-ed lemmas that
  matched 78–79% of one corpus, and Hit@1 fell from 3/5 to 2/5 while short-term queries
  improved sharply. Split long questions into short topic queries before searching.
- **No `unaccent`.** In Finnish, ä/a and ö/o are different letters: `tähti`/`tahti`,
  `sää`/`saa`.

## A result count is not evidence

The vector arm answers every query with its nearest neighbours: on one corpus, a gibberish
string returned 24 results and a real question 12. What separates them is the distance to
the **closest** chunk — 17 answerable queries scored 0.26–0.56 cosine distance, 16
unanswerable ones 0.64–0.87 — so a floor at 0.60 split them cleanly. That number belongs to
one embedding model and one corpus; take your own reading.

```python
from gaik.software_components.RAG.relevance_gate import RelevanceGate

# answerable_best / unanswerable_best: the top similarity of search_semantic(...) per query
reading = RelevanceGate.calibrate(answerable_best, unanswerable_best, lower_is_better=False)
print(reading)                   # says so plainly when the two populations overlap
gate = RelevanceGate(reading.floor, lower_is_better=False) if reading.separated else None

if gate and not gate.is_answerable(semantic, key=lambda hit: hit[1]):
    ...                          # "nothing in the library covers this"
```

- `search_semantic()` returns cosine **similarity**, higher is better, so pass
  `lower_is_better=False`. Getting the direction backwards inverts the gate with no error.
- Put ordinary questions about the wrong subject into the unanswerable set, not only
  gibberish. Gibberish separates easily; a sensible off-topic question is what users type.
- Never gate on the RRF score. It is built from rank positions, so the top hit for gibberish
  scores exactly what the top hit for a real question does, and fused scores are compressed
  — rank 1 is 1/61 and rank 20 is 1/80, a ratio of 0.76 — so a relative floor such as "30%
  of the top score" can never fire.
- Judge each result, not the page. A literal keyword match is evidence whatever its cosine;
  a vector-only hit has to clear the floor. Gating on the top hit alone lets one good
  result promote a page of unrelated ones.
- Re-take the reading whenever the embedding model or the corpus changes.

## From chunks to documents

Search ranks chunks; the reader usually sees documents. Over-fetch chunks — about four
times the documents wanted — collapse them onto their parent, and keep the **closest**
distance per document: rows arrive in fused order, so a document's first chunk is its
best-ranked, not necessarily its nearest.

Do not order documents by hit count. On one set that dropped document-level hit@1 from
0.79 to 0.63, because a long document that keeps mentioning a topic outranks the short one
that is about it. Fusing the best-chunk rank with a length-normalised hit density raised it
to 0.83 — and only for short topical queries; on long questions it moved nothing and pushed
correct chunks down.

## Measuring

Read `references/evaluating-retrieval.md` before reporting a number or adopting a change.
The rules that matter most:

- Build two query sets, short domain terms and full questions. They disagree: dropping
  common words and adding a reranker each helped one set and hurt the other.
- Measure end to end. An improvement to the keyword arm measured in isolation (hit@5 0.800
  → 0.829) was an end-to-end loss (0.790 → 0.768) once fused.
- Treat a recall of 0 as a bug until proven otherwise. One benchmark read 0% because the
  database returned bigint ids as strings and the comparison was strict.

## Rerankers

A cross-encoder reorders only the pool it is handed. On one set it raised hit@1 from 0.757
to 0.843 on full questions, did nothing for short domain terms, and made some of them
worse. `Ranker().rerank(query, hits, on_error="fallback")` returns the input order when
the model fails, but has no timeout — wrap it:
`asyncio.wait_for(asyncio.to_thread(ranker.rerank, query, hits), timeout=4)`.
Hosted rerankers often ship with tight rate limits; check the quota before designing
around one.

## Gotchas

- `Retriever(hybrid_search=True)` is not a keyword arm. It BM25-rescores the vector
  candidates (0.7 × vector + 0.3 × BM25), so a document the embedding missed cannot come
  back. `PgVectorStore.search_keyword()` is the real one.
- `search_semantic()` defaults to `threshold=0.7`. Pass `threshold=0.0` when fusing or
  gating, or the list arrives pre-cut and the gate never sees the weak cases.
- `hnsw.ef_search` defaults to 40. Raising it to 100 measured recall@20 against an exact
  scan at 96.2% → 99.2% for +0.7 ms on one 1,500-dimension corpus. On a few thousand rows
  it changes nothing — the index already returns exact neighbours.
- A filtered vector query returns fewer rows than asked unless iterative scans are on
  (pgvector 0.8+): `SET hnsw.iterative_scan = relaxed_order`, per connection or as a
  database default.
- The HNSW operator class must match the query operator. An index built with `*_l2_ops` and
  queried with `<=>` is ignored, and every search scans the table.
- `ts_rank_cd` has no IDF: in a two-word query where one word is common, that word decides
  the ranking. Dropping very common words from a short query's keyword text helps — check
  it on both query sets.
- `store.setup()` creates the `vector`, `pg_trgm` and `unaccent` extensions. On a managed
  database without that privilege, have them installed and call
  `setup(create_extensions=False)`.
- Changing the embedding model or its dimension means re-embedding everything; the column is
  `vector(N)`.
- Chunk size is a token limit, not a character one. Finnish runs about 2.5 characters per
  token, so an English-based estimate is twice too generous and an oversized chunk fails
  the whole document at the embedding endpoint.
